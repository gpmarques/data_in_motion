# data_in_motion

Project to study generative deep learning models. 

With a small database of over 440 videos with 64 frames each(after pre-processing), a deep convolutional generative adversary network was developed to try to generate videos. 

generated_video.mp4 is an example of a video generated by the gan defined at DCGAN.pynb.
DCGAN2.pynb is an attempt to create a conditional gan.

The videos used as dataset are private.
